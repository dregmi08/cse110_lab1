# Drishti Regmi's Personal Page

A little bit about me before we get started, my name is Drishti Regmi and I am a second year computer 
science major in Marshall college. I'm from Los Angeles, California, more specifically, from Porter Ranch.  

Here's my profile picture on Slack:

This webpage has two main parts: one pertaining to Drishti the person, and one pertaining to Drishti the programmer

## Part 1: Drishti the Person 
  First, some fun facts about me :
  
    - I really love going to art museums
      - Some museums that I've been to include: Norton Simon, LACMA, The Getty Villa, The Getty Center, The Broad,
        Borghese Gallery, The Louvre, Muse√© D'Orsay, the Vatican Museums
    - I journal in my free time
    - I recently have been trying to cook more, and I've been finetuning my pasta, avocado toast, and kung pao chicken recipes
    - I adore picnics, and I try to have them as often as I can with my family
    - I'm on a little bit of a film journey at the moment

    Although it's hard to communicate what describes you as a person through a simple web page, here are some pictures that can give you a 
    better idea of my hobbies and interests:

## Part 2: Drishti the Programmer

A little bit of my background as a programmer: I didn't really start coding until highschool, and even then, my exposure to coding was rather 
limited. College is when I started diving into computer science, and it's when I started to learn that computer science encompasses so much more 
than writing code. 

Here are some my favorite classes that I've taken here in the CSE department:

  1. CSE 105
  2. CSE 101
  3. CSE 100R
  4. CSE 30

 Half of the classes on the list above don't require you to write much code, and a lot of the content for those classes is very conceptual. 
 While I do enjoy theory classes, I've been trying to also develop some tcehnical skills that might come in handy for internships, jobs, and
 personal projects. A few of my programming goals for this year include:

 - [ ] Learn to use React
 - [ ] Learn to use Django
 - [ ] Learn HTML, Javascript, and CSS (especially CSS, I'm no good at web design)
 - [ ] Learn to use MongoDB
 - [ ] Improve my typing speed
 - [ ] Get more into Leetcode

Overall, my goals for this year mainly pertain to web development. Although I know that we won't just be learning about web development this 
year
